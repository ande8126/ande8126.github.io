# My resume

This is a quick resume website I built with HTML/CSS and the Bootstrap library ahead of applyhing for Prime Digital Academy.

I was really drawn to the ability of Bootstrap's ability to display and style the different elements of the pages I was buidling and tried to boost the aesthetic appeal.

I'm still thinking I might comne back to it once my work is finished at Prime, but I want to learn more before making it more than just a static website.
